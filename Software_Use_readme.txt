SasS means Software as a Service, which is a cloud-based service where instead of downloading software your desktop PC or business network
to run and update, you instead access an application via an internet browser. 

Accessibility: One strong advantage of any SaaS application is the ability to run through an internet browser,
so it doesn't matter which Operating System is used to access it. 
So regardless as to whether the user is trying to run the application on Windows, Mac, or Linux machines (or even smartphones running Android or iOS), 
the application still remains accessible.

npm is the world's largest Software Library (Registry). npm is also a software Package Manager and Installer. Open-source developers use npm to share software.
The name npm (Node Package Manager) stems from when npm first was created as a package manager for Node.js. 

All npm packages are defined in files called package.json. The content of package.json must be written in JSON.
